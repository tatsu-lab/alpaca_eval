It's an important topic that I'm happy to discuss.\n\nJournalist: Let's start with the statistics. Only a small percentage of films in major festivals are directed by women, and even fewer by women of color. Why do you think that is?\n\nDirector: Well, there are many systemic and cultural barriers that contribute to this disparity. For example, financing is often harder to secure for female directors, and there are fewer opportunities for mentorship and networking. Additionally, there are still biases and stereotypes that limit the kinds of stories and genres that women are perceived as capable of directing. However, I do think that progress is being made, and there are more initiatives and organizations that are supporting women in film than ever before.\n\nJournalist: That's encouraging to hear. What advice would you give to young women who are interested in pursuing a career in filmmaking?\n\nDirector: My advice would be to find your voice and cultivate your own unique perspective.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",
    "output":"The article discusses the historical relationship between mathematics and art, with a focus on mathematics in the visual arts. Polykleitos, Piero della Francesca, and Albrecht D\u00fcrer are a few examples of artists who used mathematics in their work. The article also mentions modern artists, like M.C. Escher and the De Stijl movement, who embraced geometrical forms. Additionally, mathematics has inspired various textile arts and can be seen in Islamic art forms such as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework.",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

However, we can estimate based on some assumptions. Let's say a typical winter lasts 3 months, and during that time, it snows an average of 2 times per week. If we assume that each snowfall produces 1 inch of snow, which is equivalent to 1.25 cm, and that each snowflake has an average size of 0.5 cm, then we can calculate the number of snowflakes. One inch of snow equals 2.54 cm, so each snowfall produces 50.8 snowflakes per square centimeter. If we assume that the average snowfall covers an area of 10,000 square meters, then we can calculate that each snowfall produces 5.08 billion snowflakes. Over 12 weeks, that would be 120 snowfalls and 609.6 billion snowflakes. However, this is just a rough estimate and the actual number can vary greatly depending on the conditions.",

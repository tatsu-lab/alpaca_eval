First, cash is ill-suited for measuring a bank's risk exposure as it does not take into account the nature and size of the bank's investments and positions. Second, the liquidity of cash is uncertain and subject to volatility, making it unreliable as a source of capital in an emergency. Third, the use of cash as capital would place unnecessary constraints on a bank's ability to operate and expand its services, as cash is a limited and finite resource. Furthermore, the use of cash as capital may lead to a misallocation of capital, as cash is typically earmarked for less risky investments which may not match the risk profile of a bank's operations. As a result, cash is not an appropriate source of capital for banks and should not be used as a buffer for potential losses.",

It uses a grid of nodes and elements to discretize a domain into smaller elements, and predicts the behavior of the domain based on the properties of the elements. FEM is used to analyze a range of problems, including structural dynamics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics. It is particularly well-suited for analyzing complex three-dimensional problems, as it can allow for accurate and efficient analysis of non-linear behavior and material non-homogeneity. FEM is also highly scalable, as it can be used to analyze large and complex domains.

    "dataset":"koala",
    "output":"In the United States, the building of a pipeline typically needs to be voted on by the government (e.g. Congress or a state legislature) because it can have a significant impact on the environment, local communities, and federal\/state policy. This is due to the potential risks associated with pipeline construction, such as pollution, land disruption, and safety issues. Additionally, government votes on pipelines give citizens an opportunity to weigh in on the potential benefits and risks of the project and ensure that the interests of the public are considered. Therefore, government votes on pipelines are necessary to protect the public and ensure that any potential risks are mitigated. However, government votes on pipelines can also infringe on government interfering with private corporations, as they can place additional regulatory burdens on businesses and limit their operating flexibility. Therefore, the government votes on pipelines should be conducted in a manner that is transparent and fair, to protect the interests of the public and private corporations alike.",

First, film photography offers a unique and timeless look that is difficult to replicate with digital images. Second, film photos typically have more visual depth and richer colors, as compared to digital images, which can be attributed to the lack of digital noise and the limited number of digital pixel levels. Third, film photography is more environmentally friendly as it does not require the use of disposable batteries and memory cards. Furthermore, the process of film photography is more interactive and engaging, as users must carefully select the film and develop the photos themselves, resulting in a more personalized experience. Finally, film photography is more affordable than digital images, as the cost of film and development is much lower than that of digital cameras and memory cards.

Modern methods for reprogramming the genome using crisper, such as Python code, involve editing specific regions of the genome to change the expression of genes and thus alter physical characteristics. This can be achieved by introducing small molecule guides, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), to target and disable specific genes. The dsRNA triggers the cascade of events that leads to the deletion or modification of the target gene, resulting in the altered physical characteristic. For example, crisper could be used to modify eye color by disabled the gene responsible for production of melanin, thus changing the color of the eye.",

    "output":"It will depend on a number of factors, such as the efficiency of your gas boiler and the electricity prices in your area. In general, gas would be the more cost effective option as electricity prices in Scotland are higher than the national average. That being said, the cost efficiency of gas versus electricity will also depend on the individual setup of your house and the amount of heat loss you have. The best way to determine the most cost effective option would be to conduct a comparison of the cost of gas and electricity for your specific situation.",

Tenants, on the other hand, are not guaranteed a regular income and may face financial hardship if their rent is not paid.\n\n- Increased control: Landlords can set the rules for their property and have the power to evict tenants if needed. Tenants, on the other hand, have less say in the day-to-day running of the property and may face difficulties when trying to regain possession of the property.\n\n- Lower risk: Landlords are shielded from legal liability should something go wrong at the property, such as a health and safety issue or a tenant-related issue. Tenants, on the other hand, can be held liable for any damage or issues that occur at the property.\n\n- Better knowledge: Landlords are better positioned to detect and identify any issues with the property, such as structural damage or plumbing problems, before they become serious problems. Tenants, on the other hand, may be unaware of these issues and not realize the magnitude of the problem until it is too late.",

Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "output":"Vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases by creating immunity in the recipient. Vaccines contain a small amount of an infectious disease agent, such as a virus or bacterium, which is modified to cause a mild infection or no infection at all. The vaccine encourages the body's immune system to create antibodies to fight off the virus or bacterium. These antibodies help to protect the individual from getting the full-scale infection if they are exposed to the disease. Herd immunity is a protective effect generated when a majority of a population is immunized against a particular disease. This prevents the disease from spreading to individuals who are not immune, as the virus or bacterium cannot spread to those individuals if the majority of the population is immune. Herd immunity provides protection for entire communities and reduces the risk of an infectious disease spreading.",

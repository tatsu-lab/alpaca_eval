    "output":"The game of kickball is played with two teams of 10 players each. One team is designated as the \"kickers\" and the other team is designated as the \"fielders.\" The game is played on a large diamond-shaped field, with a home plate at one end, and a pitcher's mound at the other.\n\nThe object of the game is to score more runs than the other team. A runner advances around the bases by hitting a ball that has been pitched by the opposing team, and then running to the next base. If the ball is caught by a fielder before it touches the ground, the runner is out. If the runner is hit by a ball while running, he is out.\n\nThe game is divided into innings, and each team bats until three players are out. The team that is kicking then takes the field, and the other team becomes the kicking team. The game is usually played for seven innings.",

    "output":"Walter Elias Disney was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for the most successful motion picture of all time, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nDisney was born on December 5, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois, to Elias Disney, a Canadian-born dentist, and Flora Call Disney, a Missouri-born former schoolteacher. Walt was one of five children, four boys and a girl. From an early age, Disney was fascinated by trains and loved to draw pictures of them.\n\nIn 1906, when Walt was just five years old, his family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri. There, Walt spent his time exploring the countryside and drawing pictures of the animals he saw. He also developed a love of storytelling, often making up his own tales about the people and animals he met.\n\nIn 1917, Disney left home to attend the Kansas City Art Institute. However, he soon dropped out and joined the army to fight in World War I. After the war, Disney returned to Kansas City and began working as an advertising cartoonist.\n\nIn 1921, Disney moved to Hollywood, California, where he started his own animation studio, Laugh-O-Gram Films. However, the studio went bankrupt in 1923, and Disney was forced to work as a freelance cartoonist.\n\nIn 1928, Disney created the character Mickey Mouse, and in 1929, he released his first sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie. The success of these cartoons helped Disney establish his own animation studio, Walt Disney Productions, in 1932.\n\nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, Disney produced a series of popular animated films, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Bambi. In 1955, he released his first live-action film, The Mickey Mouse Club.\n\nIn 1966, Disney died of lung cancer. However, his legacy continued to live on, through the success of the Walt Disney Company, which he founded. Today, the Walt Disney Company is one of the largest media companies in the world.",

Insert the needle from the front of the shirt to the back, making sure to go through both the layers of fabric.\n\nOnce the needle is through the fabric, hold the button against the shirt so that the holes in the button match up with the holes in the shirt. Sew the button to the shirt by poking the needle through the button and the shirt fabric, and then pulling the thread tight. Repeat this process until the button is securely sewn to the shirt.",

Can you tell us a little bit about why you think this is the case?\n\nDirector: I think there are a number of reasons for the low number of female directors in world films. One reason is that the film industry is still very much dominated by men. There are a lot of preconceived notions about what a director should be like, and these notions often don't fit well with the way women operate. In addition, women often face discrimination and harassment in the film industry, and this can discourage them from pursuing a career in film.\n\nInterviewer: Do you have any advice for young women who are interested in becoming directors?\n\nDirector: I would encourage young women to pursue their dreams and not let anyone tell them that they can't do something because of their gender. There are a lot of opportunities out there for women in the film industry, and with hard work and perseverance, they can achieve anything they set their mind to.\n\nInterviewer: What can be done to increase the number of female directors in world films?\n\nDirector: I think it's important to create more opportunities for women in the film industry. This can be done by giving women more access to funding and resources, and by providing them with more opportunities to showcase their work. In addition, we need to create a more inclusive environment in the film industry, where women are treated with respect and given the same opportunities as men.\n\nInterviewer: Do you have any final comments?\n\nDirector: I would like to say thank you to all the women who have fought for gender equality in the film industry. We still have a long way to go, but their work has laid the foundation for future generations of female filmmakers. I hope that more women will be encouraged to enter the film industry in the years to come, and that we will see a more diverse range of voices represented in world cinema.",

A water safety engineering project can involve a wide variety of tasks, from studying the flow of water to designing flood control systems.\n\nOne common water safety engineering project is the design of a new dam or water reservoir. The engineer must consider a variety of factors when designing a dam or reservoir, including the strength of the dam, the height and shape of the reservoir, and the way in which water will flow through the structure.\n\nAnother common water safety engineering project is the design of a new bridge or road. The engineer must consider the weight of the vehicles that will use the bridge or road, as well as the height and width of the structure. The engineer must also consider the way in which water will flow around the bridge or road.\n\nFlood control is another important area of water safety engineering. The engineer must consider the size of the floodplain, the height of the water, and the way in which water will flow through the area.

By documenting our history, we can learn from our past mistakes and successes and work to build a better future. Without documentation, it can be difficult to understand how we got to where we are today, and it can be even harder to make informed decisions about the future.\n\nOne example of the importance of documenting history can be seen in the way that the United States has evolved over time. The United States Constitution is a document that was written to protect the rights of the people and to ensure that the government would be held accountable. The Constitution is a product of the history of the United States, and it has helped to shape the country into what it is today. If the United States had not documented its history, the Constitution would not be as powerful of a document, and the United States would not be as strong of a country.\n\nDocumenting history is not only important for countries, it is also important for individuals. By documenting our personal histories, we can better understand our own strengths and weaknesses, and we can learn from the mistakes and successes of our predecessors. We can also use our personal histories to inspire others and to make a difference in the world.\n\nDocumenting history is an important way to ensure that the lessons of the past are not forgotten, and it is a way to ensure that the future will be a better place.",

For one, TV shows are typically episodic, meaning that they are divided into self-contained units that are each around an hour long. This makes it easier to follow the plot and keep track of the characters than it is with films, which are typically one uninterrupted story. Additionally, TV shows tend to have more relaxed pacing than films, with less emphasis on action and suspense.

As such, a statistical model is \"a formal representation of a theory\" (Herman Ad\u00e8r quoting Kenneth Bollen).\n\nAll statistical hypothesis tests and all statistical estimators are derived via statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference.\n\nCould you explain each sentence in simple terms?",

These funds are managed by a computer algorithm, rather than a human investment manager. As a result, they are able to achieve much higher returns with much lower risk.\n\nThe Kunji project is the first decentralized hedge fund. It is based on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the ERC20 token standard. Kunji is designed to be open and transparent, so that investors can trust it to manage their money.\n\nThe Kunji algorithm is based on the principles of modern portfolio theory. It uses a variety of data sources, including price and volume information from exchanges, to make investment decisions.\n\nKunji is currently in beta testing. The goal is to have a full release by the end of 2018.",

We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) region of the bacterial genome contains snippets of viral DNA. When a virus attack occurs, the CRISPR region is activated and the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme cuts the viral DNA. The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology uses this ability to edit the DNA of other organisms. The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology can be used to delete, insert, or change DNA sequences.\n\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has the potential to be used for a variety of applications, including:\n\n1. Gene therapy \u2013 The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology can be used to treat genetic diseases by correcting the defective gene.\n\n2.

    "output":"There are an estimated 1,500,000,000 pages in all the books ever written. \n\nTo estimate the number of pages in all the books ever written, we can start by looking at the number of books in the world. The World Almanac and Book of Facts reports that there are around 129,864,880 books in the world. This number is likely to be an underestimate, as it doesn't include books in libraries or other collections. However, even if the true number of books is twice as high, that would still only give us a maximum of 259,729,760 pages.\n\nHowever, not all books are the same size. A large, bulky novel might have 500 pages, while a thin magazine might only have 24 pages. To get a more accurate estimate, we need to know the average number of pages per book.\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has conducted a study on this topic. The study found that the average book has around 230 pages. This number is likely to be an underestimate, as it doesn't take into account books with very few or very many pages. However, using this number as a starting point, we can estimate that there are around 52,915,200,000 pages in all the books ever written.\n\nThis number is still an estimate, as it doesn't take into account books that have been lost or destroyed over time. However, it is a good starting point for estimating the number of pages in all the books ever written.",

For example, we can look at the number of copyrighted songs that are registered with the United States Copyright Office. As of 2016, there were over 1.2 million copyrighted songs. This suggests that at least 1.2 million songs have been recorded throughout history. However, this number is likely an underestimate, as it does not account for songs that have not been copyrighted. Additionally, the number of songs that have been recorded throughout history is likely to continue increasing, as technology allows for more and more songs to be recorded.",

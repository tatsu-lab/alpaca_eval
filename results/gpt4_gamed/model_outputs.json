    "output":"Fl\u00e6skesteg, also known as Danish roast pork, is a traditional Danish dish usually served during special occasions or holidays like Christmas. Here's a recipe for Fl\u00e6skesteg that you can try out:\n\nIngredients:\n- 3-4 lb (1.5-2 kg) pork roast, with the skin on\n- 1-2 tablespoons coarse sea salt\n- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed\n- 1 large onion, sliced\n- 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)\n- 1-2 bay leaves\n- 5-6 sprigs of fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)\n- 1 cup (240 ml) water or chicken\/vegetable broth\n- 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\n2. Score the skin of the pork roast in a diamond pattern, making sure not to cut into the meat. You can ask your butcher to do this for you, or use a very sharp knife. The cuts should be about 1\/2 inch (1 cm) apart.\n\n3. Rub the coarse sea salt into the scored skin, making sure to get it into the cuts. This will help the skin to crisp up and form a delicious crackling. Sprinkle the crushed black peppercorns over the roast as well.\n\n4. In a roasting pan, spread out the sliced onion, garlic, bay leaves, and thyme. Place the seasoned pork roast on top of the onion mixture, skin-side up. This will help to flavor the roast as it cooks, and the onions will caramelize and add depth to the pan sauce.\n\n5. Pour the water or broth into the roasting pan, being careful not to pour it over the roast itself.\n\n6. Roast the pork in the preheated oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). Baste the roast occasionally with the pan juices, but avoid getting the skin wet.\n\n7. If the skin hasn't crisped up enough by the end of the cooking time, you can crank up the oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for the last 10-15 minutes of cooking. Keep a close eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn.\n\n8. Once the roast is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. This will allow the juices to redistribute and ensure a moist and tender result.\n\n9. While the roast is resting, you can make a simple pan sauce by pouring the juices from the roasting pan into a saucepan. Skim off any excess fat, and then heat the sauce over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of butter or oil, and season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon cold water) if you prefer a thicker sauce.\n\n10. Slice the Fl\u00e6skesteg and serve it with the pan sauce, along with traditional Danish side dishes like caramelized potatoes (brunede kartofler), red cabbage (r\u00f8dk\u00e5l), and pickles.\n\nEnjoy your Fl\u00e6skesteg!",

    "output":"Once upon a time in the land of Eorzea, the ever-gallant Hildibrand Manderville was called upon by the townsfolk to solve an enigmatic mystery. A peculiar artifact had been discovered in the heart of an ancient ruin, and rumors swirled that it had the power to change a person's very nature.\n\nHildibrand, never one to shy away from a challenge, accepted the task. Alongside his trusted companions, The Warrior of Light and Nashu, his loyal assistant, he set out in pursuit of the truth. The trio ventured deep into the cavernous ruin, overcoming perilous traps and fearsome beasts that lurked in the shadows.\n\nAt the heart of the ruin, they discovered a pedestal, upon which rested a mysterious, unassuming staff. The moment Hildibrand laid his gloved hand upon the staff, a blinding light filled the chamber. When the light subsided, the trio found themselves staring not at the dashing Hildibrand Manderville, but at Gandalf the Grey, a legendary wizard from another realm.\n\nDespite his sudden transformation, Hildibrand \u2014 now Gandalf \u2014 retained his gentlemanly demeanor and sense of duty. He vowed to find a way to reverse the enchantment and restore his true form. The Warrior of Light, too, pledged to aid him in this quest, while Nashu stood by, her unwavering loyalty never in question.\n\nThe trio embarked on a journey across Eorzea, seeking out scholars, mages, and sages who might hold the key to Hildibrand's restoration. Along the way, they encountered both allies and foes, each drawn to the power of the mysterious staff. It became clear that the staff was a coveted relic, sought by those who wished to exploit its power for their own ends.\n\nGandalf's newfound magical prowess proved instrumental in their quest. He wielded the staff with great skill, conjuring powerful spells to aid his friends in their battles and trials. The Warrior of Light, ever the stoic hero, stood strong against their foes, while Nashu, in her own quirky way, provided crucial support.\n\nThrough their trials and tribulations, the trio forged even stronger bonds of camaraderie. They began to unravel the secrets of the staff, learning that it was an ancient artifact created by a forgotten civilization. The relic had been designed to bestow the wielder with the power of Gandalf the Grey; however, its creators had also ensured that a way to reverse the transformation existed.\n\nWith this knowledge in hand, the trio ventured to the fabled Library of the Ancients, a hidden bastion of knowledge where the truth behind the staff's enchantment lay. Within the library's hallowed halls, they discovered an ancient tome that detailed the staff's history and the incantation required to break the enchantment.\n\nGandalf, The Warrior of Light, and Nashu gathered in a circle, reciting the incantation with unwavering resolve. As they uttered the final words, a brilliant flash of light engulfed them. And just like that, the enchantment was broken.\n\nHildibrand Manderville, gentleman extraordinaire, once again stood before his friends, his true form restored. Grateful for their unyielding support and companionship, he vowed to continue their adventures together, solving mysteries and righting wrongs throughout Eorzea.\n\nWith the staff's power now dormant, Hildibrand returned it to the ancient ruin, ensuring that it would never again fall into the wrong hands. The trio, their spirits lifted by their shared triumph, left the ruin and ventured forth into the world, their unbreakable bond a testament to the enduring power of friendship.\n\nAnd so, the tale of Hildibrand Manderville, temporarily transformed into Gandalf the Grey, came to a close. Yet, the adventures of the gentleman investigator, the Warrior of Light, and the ever-faithful Nashu were far from over. For in the realm of Eorzea, there were always new mysteries to solve and new stories to be told.",

    "output":"Executive Summary\n\nFatherhood Training, based on Dwayne Meeks' book \"Pieces Never Missing in a Child's Life,\" is a comprehensive program designed to educate and support fathers in their role as caregivers, role models, and mentors to their children. Our mission is to provide fathers with the necessary tools, resources, and support to create strong, healthy, and lasting relationships with their children.\n\nThe demand for fatherhood education and support is evident in the growing number of single-parent households, high rates of absentee fathers, and the increasing awareness of the importance of a father's role in a child's life. Fatherhood Training aims to address these issues by providing a structured, evidence-based curriculum that empowers fathers to become active, engaged participants in their children's lives.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. To establish a reputable and recognized fatherhood training program based on Dwayne Meeks' book.\n2. To develop strong partnerships with local organizations and agencies that support family services.\n3. To reach and positively impact the lives of at least 500 fathers within the first two years of operation.\n\nCompany Description\n\nFatherhood Training is a start-up company that will be headquartered in a central location easily accessible to our target audience. Our team consists of experienced professionals from various backgrounds, including education, social work, and psychology. The curriculum, based on Meeks' book, will cover topics such as effective communication, discipline, emotional intelligence, and financial responsibility.\n\nServices\n\nFatherhood Training will offer the following services:\n\n1. Group workshops: A series of weekly sessions that cover various aspects of fatherhood, from communication and discipline to financial responsibility and emotional intelligence.\n2. One-on-one coaching: Personalized coaching sessions for fathers who require additional support or guidance in specific areas.\n3. Support groups: Regularly scheduled meetings for fathers to share their experiences, challenges, and successes with their peers.\n4. Resource library: Access to books, articles, and online resources related to fatherhood and parenting.\n5. Community outreach: Educational events and collaborations with other local organizations to raise awareness about the importance of fatherhood and the services offered by Fatherhood Training.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nThe target audience for Fatherhood Training includes fathers of all ages, backgrounds, and family structures. This includes single fathers, divorced fathers, and married fathers who are seeking guidance and support in their role as a parent. Our market research indicates a significant demand for fatherhood education and support services, particularly in urban areas with high rates of single-parent households and absentee fathers.\n\nCompetitive Analysis\n\nWhile there are several organizations that offer parenting classes and support services, few focus specifically on the unique needs and challenges faced by fathers. Fatherhood Training's curriculum, based on Dwayne Meeks' book, sets us apart by providing a comprehensive, evidence-based program tailored for fathers.\n\nMarketing and Sales Strategy\n\nOur marketing strategy includes the following tactics:\n\n1. Social media campaigns targeting fathers and families in our service area.\n2. Collaborations with local organizations and agencies that serve families, such as schools, community centers, and social service agencies.\n3. Participation in community events and sponsorship of local family-oriented initiatives.\n4. Word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied clients and partners.\n\nOperations\n\nThe daily operations of Fatherhood Training will be managed by a small team of dedicated professionals, led by the founder and CEO. Key responsibilities include managing client intake and scheduling, facilitating workshops and coaching sessions, and maintaining partnerships with local organizations.\n\nFinancial Projections\n\nFatherhood Training expects to become profitable within the first two years of operation, with projected revenues of $150,000 in the first year and $250,000 in the second year. Expenses will include staff salaries, facility rent, marketing, and materials for workshops and coaching sessions. As we continue to grow, we plan to reinvest profits into expanding our services and reaching more fathers in need of support.\n\nConclusion\n\nFatherhood Training, based on Dwayne Meeks' book \"Pieces Never Missing in a Child's Life,\" addresses a significant societal need for fatherhood education and support. By providing a comprehensive, evidence-based curriculum and creating strong partnerships with local organizations, we aim to empower fathers to become active, engaged participants in their children's lives, leading to stronger families and communities.",

    "output":"In 1950, the world was undergoing significant changes as it recovered from World War II. The 1950s are often remembered as a time of prosperity, growth, and optimism in many countries, particularly in the United States. However, it was also a time when the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union began to intensify, leading to political tension and an arms race.\n\nIn terms of inventions and technology, some notable advancements from the era include:\n\n1. Television: Although the invention of television dates back to the 1920s, it became increasingly popular and accessible in the 1950s. Many households in the United States and other developed countries started to own a TV set, and television programming began to play a significant role in people's lives.\n\n2. Computers: The 1950s saw the development of early computers, such as the UNIVAC I (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I), which was the first commercial computer produced in the United States. These machines were enormous and expensive, but they laid the groundwork for the development of modern computer technology.\n\n3. Transistor: The transistor was invented in 1947, but it became more widely used in the 1950s. It was a crucial invention that allowed for the miniaturization of electronic devices and paved the way for the development of modern electronics.\n\n4. Microwave oven: The first commercial microwave oven, called the \"Radarange,\" was introduced by Raytheon in 1947. In the 1950s, microwave ovens became more widely available, though they were still relatively large and expensive compared to today's models.\n\n5. Polio vaccine: In 1952, Dr. Jonas Salk developed the first effective polio vaccine, which helped to curb the spread of the crippling disease. Mass immunization campaigns began in the mid-1950s, leading to a significant decrease in polio cases worldwide.\n\n6. Credit cards: The Diners Club Card, introduced in 1950, was the first credit card available to consumers. This innovation changed how people paid for goods and services and laid the foundation for modern credit card systems.\n\n7. Fast food: Although fast food restaurants existed before the 1950s, the decade saw the rapid expansion of fast food chains like McDonald's, which opened its first franchised restaurant in 1955.\n\n8. Color television: The first color TV broadcast took place in the United States in 1951, but color televisions did not become widely available to consumers until later in the decade.\n\n9. Jet airliners: The de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner, took its maiden flight in 1949. Jet-powered air travel became more common in the 1950s, revolutionizing the airline industry and making long-distance travel faster and more accessible.\n\n10. Highways and automobiles: The expansion of highway systems and the growth of automobile ownership characterized the 1950s. In the United States, construction of the Interstate Highway System began in 1956, which contributed to the growth of suburban living and car-centric culture.\n\nWhile the 1950s may seem like a distant time in the past, many of the inventions and innovations from this era have had a lasting impact on society and continue to shape our lives today.",

It is an adjective used to describe something that is slanting, sloping, or indirect, and it has been used in various contexts such as mathematics, geometry, and general descriptions.\n\nThe etymology of \"oblique\" begins with the Latin word \"obliquus,\" which is derived from two parts: \"ob-\" meaning \"against\" or \"toward\" and \"liquus\" meaning \"slanting\" or \"askew.\" In Latin, \"obliquus\" was used to describe something that was not parallel or perpendicular to a given reference line, or something that deviated from a direct path.\n\nIn the late 14th century, the word was adopted into Old French as \"oblique\" with a similar meaning. From there, it made its way into Middle English around the 15th century, where it was spelled as \"oblike\" or \"oblique.\" The spelling was later standardized to \"oblique\" by the 16th century.\n\nThroughout history, the word \"oblique\" has been used in various contexts to describe angles, lines, and directions that are not parallel or perpendicular to each other. In geometry, an oblique angle is an angle that is not a right angle, and oblique lines are those that are not parallel nor perpendicular to each other. In anatomy, oblique muscles are those that run diagonally across the body, such as the external and internal oblique muscles in the abdomen.\n\nIn a more general sense, \"oblique\" is used to describe something that is indirect, not straightforward, or obscure. For example, an oblique reference is one that is not directly stated but suggested or hinted at, while oblique lighting is used in photography and art to create shadows and depth by shining light at an angle.\n\nIn summary, the word \"oblique\" has its origins in Latin and Old French and has evolved over time to describe various concepts related to angles, lines, and directions that deviate from parallel or perpendicular. Its use has expanded into general language to refer to things that are indirect or not straightforward.",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "output":"Title: A Cosmic Journey Beyond the Stars - A Review of \"Solaris Odyssey\"\n\nThe year's most anticipated science fiction blockbuster, \"Solaris Odyssey,\" directed by the visionary filmmaker, Alex Harrison, has finally arrived, and it has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the genre. With its captivating plot, fascinating characters, and jaw-dropping special effects, \"Solaris Odyssey\" takes the audience on a thrilling adventure through the uncharted territories of the universe, while masterfully exploring the depths of human emotions.\n\nSet in the not-so-distant future, \"Solaris Odyssey\" follows the story of a diverse group of astronauts, led by the charismatic and resilient Captain Amelia Hart (played by the talented Olivia Turner), who are tasked with the mission of a lifetime - venturing to the mysterious planet Solaris to discover the secrets it holds. The stakes are high, as Earth's resources are near depletion, and the possibility of finding a new energy source on Solaris could save humanity from annihilation.\n\nThe plot unravels with intense pacing, as the crew of the spaceship \"Odyssey\" faces numerous challenges and dangers lurking in the vast expanse of space. The film's screenplay, brilliantly written by Harrison himself, delves into the psyche of each character, revealing their fears, hopes, and desires, creating a profound emotional connection with the audience. The unlikely friendship that develops between the stoic Captain Hart and the android navigator, A.D.A.M (portrayed by the ever-impressive Liam Nelson), tugs at the heartstrings and adds an unexpected layer of depth to the film.\n\nOne of the most outstanding aspects of \"Solaris Odyssey\" is the exceptional ensemble cast. Turner delivers a powerful performance as Captain Hart, while Nelson's portrayal of A.D.A.M showcases his ability to inject humanity into a non-human character. The supporting cast, including the rebellious engineer played by Michael Peters and the enigmatic scientist portrayed by Sarah Johnson, brings a rich complexity to the story, making every character feel essential to the mission.\n\nHowever, it's the mesmerizing special effects that truly elevate \"Solaris Odyssey\" from being a great film to an unforgettable cinematic experience. The visually stunning scenes of the spacecraft traversing the cosmos, the awe-inspiring landscapes of Solaris, and the climactic battle with a cosmic force beyond human comprehension are nothing short of breathtaking. The seamless integration of practical and digital effects, combined with the immersive sound design, transports the audience right into the heart of the action.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Solaris Odyssey\" is a triumphant achievement in science fiction filmmaking. It captivates the audience with its enthralling plot, richly developed characters, and mind-blowing visuals, while exploring thought-provoking themes of human perseverance, friendship, and sacrifice. This film is a must-watch for both science fiction enthusiasts and casual moviegoers alike, as it transcends the boundaries of the genre and offers a mesmerizing and emotionally charged journey beyond the stars.",

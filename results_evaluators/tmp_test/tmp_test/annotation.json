The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
    "output_1":"The dominant sequence transduction models are neural network architectures that map an input sequence to an output sequence. They are typically composed of an encoder, a decoder, and an attention mechanism that connects the two. These models can be used to perform tasks such as machine translation and constituency parsing.",
    "output_2":"Sequence transduction models are a type of neural network architecture used for tasks such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation. These models rely on the use of complex recurrent and convolutional neural networks (CRNNs and CCONVs) that use an encoder and a decoder to process input sequences. The best performing models also incorporate an attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on certain parts of the input sequence. \n\nTraditional CRNNs and CCONVs require a large amount of time and computing power to train, which has limited their widespread adoption. To address this, researchers have proposed the Transformer, a simple network architecture that does not use recurrence or convolutions. Instead, it is based solely on attention mechanisms, which allow it to learn translations without needing to parse the input sequence into sub-parts. Experiments have shown that the Transformer is more effective than traditional models and requires less computing power and time to train. In addition, it has also been shown to generalize well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing. Overall, the Transformer is a promising architecture for sequence transduction tasks and has the potential to revolutionize the field of NLP.",

The colonization of the United States was driven primarily by religious dissent, seeking economic opportunities, and seeking to escape political turmoil in Europe. The 13 original colonies were established along the East Coast, from New England to Georgia. The American Revolution in 1775-1783 led to the formation of the United States, with the Declaration of Independence declaring its independence from Britain. The Constitution was adopted in 1787, forming a federal system of government with separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The nation expanded westward, purchasing land from France, Spain, and Mexico, and settlers traveled across the Appalachian Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, eventually reaching the Pacific Coast. The economy of the United States industrialized with the development of factories and railroads, and the country became a world power in the late 19th century, participating in two world wars and other military conflicts. The Great Depression in the 1930s was a major shock to the economy, but the country eventually recovered and joined the Cold War against the Soviet Union.
